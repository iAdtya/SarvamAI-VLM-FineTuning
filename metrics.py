They were wrong.\nThey miscalculated India\u2019s re-\nsolve, they did not comprehend\nthe sense of national outrage at\nthis blatant breach of trust, the\nsheer motivation of the Indian\nsoldiers and the leadership qual-\nity of the Indian Army officers\nwho led from the front.\n\nPerhaps, Pakistan calculated on\nprovoking India into an escala-\ntion. They were wrong again be-\ncause the decision of not cross-\ning the LoC was taken early and\nmaintained scrupulously, in the\nface of high casualities and even\nwhen the decision to employ air\npower was taken. The area of\nconflict was not expanded. Pa-\nkistan having disowned its troops\nas \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d, could\nhardly thereafter have opened\nup a new front, to ease pressure\nin Kargil.\n\nWhat of the future? Looking be-\nyond Kargil provides us an op-\nportunity to renew our faith in\nourselves, our society, our pol-\nity and our nation. It compels us\nto look ahead in all fields of\nnational endeavour but particu-\nlarly, in the spheres of national\nsecurity and foreign policy. One\nsimple message emanating from\n\n4 INDIANEWS \u00a9 August 15, 1999\n\nGo gle\n\nKargil is that adequate resources\nhave to be made available for\nnational defence, that the kind\nof relegation of defence needs\nthat we witnessed in the late\neighties and nineties is unsound\npolicy, that technological up-\ngradation cannot be postponed,\nthat the nation must always think\nof the welfare of those who are\nin the first rank of its defence.\n\nKargil has many pointers for our\nforeign policy and diplomacy\ntoo. As in the present instance,\nwe should always be ready to\nengage with the world as full and\nresponsible members of the in-\nternational community, but, of\ncourse, keeping our national\npriorities and interests as the\nguiding principle; we ought to\nhave no reluctance, leave alone\nfear, in engaging with the world\non any issue. Indeed, we serve\nthe national interest when we en-\ngage the world on the basis of\nequality and mutual respect.\nSuch engagement is the very\nsubstance of diplomacy. That is\nnot any internationalization of an\nissue. Nor does it imply media-\ntion or any acceptance of inter-\nmediaries.\n\nIssues have to be addressed bi-\nlaterally between concerned\ncountries, and in the case of India\nand Pakistan, that is what the\nLahore process is all about. We\nwould like to renew that process\nand we would like Pakistan to\nfacilitate a resumption of the\nprocess, by reaffirming the in-\nviolability and sanctity of the Line\nof Control. Clearly, a sponsor-\nship of terrorism across the Line\nof Control, or elsewhere, is a\nviolation of the Line of Control,\nas indeed of Simla Agreement\nand Lahore Declaration. There\n\nis a need, for Pakistan, to abjure\nsponsoring, aiding or abetting\ncross-border terrorism. These\nare not any pre-conditions for\ndialogue. We are after all, the\ninitiators of this dialogue pro-\ncess and our commitment to it\nis firm and abiding. But it is only\nright for our nation, at this junc-\nture, to expect that Pakistan will\nrepair the damage that it has\ndone to trust, that it demon-\nstrates this through concrete and\ntangible steps. Trust is not built\nby engaging in dialogue in win-\nter and committing aggression\nin summer. Continuous calls for\nJihad can also hardly be read as\nmessages for dialogue and\npeace. And it is in this vein that\nI suggest that high pitched pro-\npaganda against India also does\nnot inspire confidence in Paki-\nstan\u2019s interest in dialogue.\n\nI would venture to suggest that\nPakistan, too, has to come to\nterms with its history, as indeed\nwith its geography. It has to re-\nalize that there simply is no\nmilitary solution to what it pre-\nsumes is its locus-standii in\nJammu and Kashmir. It is, of\ncourse, for Pakistan to determine\nits priorities but fomenting reli-\ngious fundamentalism can hardly\nbe employed as a tool against\nwant and poverty. India recog-\nnizes the permanance of the\nsovereign state of Pakistan and\nthat is final. While India remains\nready for dialogue, the pace at\nwhich it can move forward will\ndepend entirely on when and\nhow the state of Pakistan, and\nwhat it has now become, per-\nmits it to do so.\n\nOur foreign policy has not been\nfixated on Pakistan, but that has\nbeen a significant preoccupation",

No development will\nbe sustainable or justifiable that ignores Nature and the\nhuman being.\n\nOn the 26th of November this year it will be 50 years since\nwe adopted, enacted and gave to ourselves the Constitu-\ntion of India. The Constitution is the sheet anchor of our\npolity. It is my earnest hope that it would continue to be\nTespected by all, and be an instrument of social change\nand transformation of the status of the underprivileged as\nenvisaged by Babasaheb Ambedkar.\n\nScience and technology, which occupy the centre stage in\nour progress is paying heed to the human dimensions of\ndevelopment. Thanks to the efforts put in during the first\ntwo or three decades India can today boast of a stabilized\ngreen revolution, a diversified industrial infrastructure, and\na Science and Technology-base for our further develop-\nment. While Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s vision of \u201cscience solving\nthe problem of hunger and poverty\u201d in our country has not\nyet been fulfilled, we have been able to break the back of\nthe demon of hunger by resort to science in our agricul-\nture. Our progress in the development of satellites, atomic\nenergy, information technology and bio-technology are\nnot merely climbing the high peaks of Science and Tech-\nnology, but are applying the techniques to grass-root prob-\nlems and to the human needs of the country. It is hearten-\ning that our scientists are now wide awake to the impor-\ntance of patenting our diverse genetic riches before they\nare taken away by the advanced nations. India is bound to\nemerge as a major scientific-technological power in the\nnew millennium.\n\nRolling back or putting a cap on the advancement of\nscience is contrary to the very spirit and nature of science,\nand against the equitable world order that we are pledged\nto bring into being.\n\nFriends, in a few weeks from now the people of India will\nbe exercising their franchise to elect the 13th Lok Sabha\nand some of the State Assemblies. Our record of orderly\nelections, which form the basis of our democratic polity, is\nnow acknowledged by the world. Indian voters have exer-\ncised their franchise and chosen their representatives with\npractical common sense; they have reposed confidence\nwith generosity; withdrawn it without ambiguity; created,\npreserved and demolished mandates. No one dares take\nthe Indian voter for granted. It is gratifying for us that today\nthe world significance of Indian democracy has begun to\ndawn upon the developed democracies of the world. But\nstill we must not forget that often in global power-politics\nthe blood of strategic affinity is thicker than the life-giving\nwaters of democracy.\n\nI would like to avail this opportunity to urge all contestants\nand campaigners in the coming polls to maintain our\ndemocracy\u2019s track record, to abjure appeals of a narrow\nsectarian nature and show a broad tolerance of opinions of\nothers. I trust that the ugly phenomenon of voter-intimida-\ntion and booth-capturing which has marred voting in some\n\nGoogle\n\npockets in the past, will not be tolerated anywhere on this\noccasion. The firmness shown in this regard by our Elec-\ntion Commission has been widely appreciated.\n\nOur Election Commission, our Judiciary and other Consti-\ntutional authorities like the Office of the Comptroller and\nAuditor General of India, are institutions of which we are\nproud for their impartiality, objectivity and sense of re-\nsponsibility.\n\nLikewise we derive great satisfaction from the functioning\nof the National Commissions that have been set up for the\nwelfare of our minorities, women, scheduled castes and\nscheduled tribes and other vulnerable sections of our so-\nciety.\n\nFellow citizens and friends, on this last Independence Day\nof the century we have every reason to look forward to the\nnew millennium with hope and self-assurance. Despite all\nthe obstacles set in our path we are well served by the\nstrength of our democratic institutions and we draw suste-\nnance from our rich heritage from the past and from the\nreawakened spirit of our people. In this spirit we send our\ngreetings to our neighbours in South Asia - to Bangladesh,\nNepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Pakistan with\nwhom we are engaged in the adventure of building up\nSAARC as a prosperous and viable regional entity. We\nalso send our greetings to the friendly countries of ASEAN\nwith whom we are closely associated, to Japan and to the\ncountries of West Asia and Central Asia with whom we\nhave traditional ties of friendship. | am delighted that our\nrelations with the People\u2019s Republic of China have im-\nproved. On the 50th anniversary of the founding of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and of the establishment of\ndiplomatic relations between the two countries, | would\nlike to send our warm greetings to the people and govern-\nment of China. It is a matter of satisfaction to us that our\nrelations with the countries of the sister continent of Africa,\nthe Commonwealth of Nations, the European Union and\nthe United States of America are marked by warmth and\nunderstanding. Our close relations with our time-tested\nfriend, Russia, continue to develop and diversify in several\nfields as well as in multilateral fora; this is most gratifying.\n\nFrom the inception of our independence India has been\nstriving for a one-world that is free from the scourge of war\nand free of weapons of mass destruction. In the new\ncentury that is at our doorstep we pledge ourselves to\npersist with this effort. Towards this we would like to see\nthe full potential and scope of the United Nations Organi-\nzation realized through wider representation and restruc-\nturing.

How would you\nassess the results so far?\nFirst, by restating the objec-\ntives from our side. They are\ntwo-fold: in the first place, to\nreconcile the stated U.S. non-\nproliferation concerns with\nIndia\u2019s national security ob-\njectives; secondly, and, in a\nbroader context, to develop\ngreater mutual understanding so that both countries\nare enabled to work together in tapping the real poten-\ntial of a qualitatively new relationship, essential in\nthis post-Cold War environment.\n\n   \n\nJaswant Singh\n\nThe results of my discussions with Mr. Strobe Talbott\nare encouraging. There is recognition that India shall\nmaintain a minimum nuclear deterrent as determined\nby us. There is now no longer any talk of a \u2018roll-back\u2019.\nThe U.S. also accepts that India\u2019s security concerns\nare not geographically limited. Foreign policy tasks\nand challenges are a continuing process, therefore,\nwe need to consolidate these understandings across\nall sections that make up the U.S. foreign policy\nestablishment.\n\nDo you have a timeframe for concluding this\ndialogue?\n\nIn the management of foreign policy, deadlines are\nboth impractical and unrealistic. But if we manage\nthrough the objectives, then the first part is the\nrestoration of our relationship to the pre-May 1998\nposition. As for the next, | would consider it attained\nwhen both India and the U.S. engage in regular\n\naid dialogue on a range of issues covering bilateral,\n\naur\n\nos regional and global political and economic issues.\n\nels v Can you define these issues?\n\ns\nas Of course, | cannot draw up a total list. But, self-\n\nGoogle\n\nevidently, these would range from discussing coop-\neration in the field of energy, science and technology,\nenvironment, trade, taxation and economic develop-\nment, to global concerns such as terrorism, narcotics,\nnon-proliferation, disarmament, reform of multilateral\ninstitutions, expansion of the U.N. Security Council\nand regional developments in Asia-Pacific etc. Obvi-\nously, a multifaceted dialogue of this nature can\nsimply not imply an agreement on all; it is the den-\nsity and depth of engagement that is the criteria.\n\nA principal item on the agenda is the CTBT and\nthere seems to be considerable confusion about\nIndia\u2019s stand on this issue. Where exactly are\nwe?\n\nOur stand on the CTBT has been clear. In 1996, we\ndecided that we could not accept the CTBT because\nit was not consistent with India\u2019s national security\ninterest. Over the decades, successive Governments\ntook necessary steps to safeguard India\u2019s nuclear\noption. In 1996, it was clear to all that subscription\nto the CTBT at that time would have limited India's\nnuclear potential at an unacceptably low level. After\nconducting the nuclear tests of May 1998, to validate\nand update our technology, we have ensured the\ncredibility of our nuclear deterrent into the foresee-\nable future; our scientists are now confident of\nconducting sub-critical tests, as also other non-\nexplosive R&D activity necessary for the purpose.\nThat is why, we declared a voluntary moratorium.\nThis, in essence, meets the basic obligations of the\nCTBT. We also announced a willingness to convert\nthis undertaking into a de jure obligation. Clearly,\nthis could not be done in a political vacuum. A\npositive environment had to be created.

He was Prime Minister for a\nshort period in 1996. He is the only Prime Minister\nsince Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to have become Prime\nMinister of India through three successive mandates.\n\nA veteran Parliamentarian whose career stretches\nover four decades, Shri Vajpayee has been elected to\nthe Lok Sabha (House of the People) nine times and\nto the Rajya Sabha (House of the States) twice, a\nrecord by itself. As India\u2019s Foreign Minister, Chair-\nperson of various important Standing Committees of\nParliament and Leader of Opposition, he has been an\nactive participant in the shaping of India\u2019s post-\nIndependence domestic and foreign policy.\n\nShri Vajpayee\u2019s first brush with nationalist politics\nwas in his student days when he joined the Quit\n\n \n\nIndia Movement of 1942, which hastened the end of\nBritish colonial rule. A student of political science\nand law, it was in college that he developed a keen\ninterest in foreign affairs \u2014 an interest he has nour-\nished over the years and put to skillful use while\nrepresenting India at various multilateral and bilateral\nfora.\n\nShri Vajpayee had embarked upon a journalist\u2019s\ncareer, which was cut short in 1951 when he joined\nthe Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the forerunner of today's\nBharatiya Janata Party, the leading component of the\nNational Democratic Alliance. A critically acclaimed\npoet, he still takes time off from affairs of state to\nindulge in music and in a bit of gourmet cooking.\n\nBorn in the family of a humble school teacher on\nDecember 25, 1924, in the erstwhile princely State of\nGwalior (now a part of the Indian state of Madhya\nPradesh), Shri Vajpayee\u2019s rise in public life is a trib-\nute to both his political acumen and Indian democ-\nracy. Over the decades, he has emerged as a leader\nwho commands respect for his liberal worldview and\ncommitment to democratic ideals.\n\nAn ardent champion of women\u2019s empowerment and\nsocial equality, Vajpayee believes in a forward-look-\ning, forward moving India, a strong and prosperous\nnation confident of its rightful place in the comity of\nnations. He stands for an India anchored in 5000\nyears of civilizational history, ever modernizing, ever\nrenewing, and ever re-energizing itself to meet the\nchallenges of the next 1000 years.\n\nIndia\u2019s second highest civilian honor, the Padma\nVibhushan, was conferred upon him in recognition\nof his selfless dedication to his first and only love,\nIndia, and his more than half-a-century of service to\nsociety and the nation.

In the future, it will\nfocus as well on the development of clean energy,\nhealth, and education.\n\nOur partnership is not an end in itself, but a means\nto all these ends. And it is reinforced by the ties of\nscholarship, commerce, and increasingly of kinship\namong our people. The industry, enterprise and\ncultural contributions of Americans of Indian heri-\ntage have enriched and enlivened both our societies.\n\nToday, we pledge to deepen the Indian-American\npartnership in tangible ways, always seeking to rec-\noncile our differences through dialogue and engage-\nment, always seizing opportunities to advance the\ncountless interests we have in common. As a first\nstep, President Clinton has invited Prime Minister\nVajpayee to visit Washington at a mutually conve-\nnient opportunity, and the Prime Minister has ac-\ncepted that invitation. Henceforth, the President of\nthe United States and the Prime Minister of India\nshould meet regularly to institutionalize our dia-\nlogue. We have also agreed on and separately out-\nlined an architecture of additional high-level consul-\ntations, and of joint working groups, across the broad\nspectrum of areas in which we are determined to\ninstitutionalize our enhanced cooperation. And we\nwill encourage even stronger people-to-people ties.\n\nFor India and the United States, this is a day of new\nbeginnings. We have before us for the first time in 50\nyears the possibility to realize the full potential of our\nrelationship. We will work to seize that chance, for\nour benefit and all those with whom we share this\nincreasingly interdependent world.\n\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee\nPrime Minister of India\n\nWilliam Jefferson Clinton\nPresident of the United States of America\n\nDone on March 21, 2000 at New Delhi\n\n \n\nGoogle",

    "india_news_p000131.jpg": "India-U.S. Economic Relations\n\nCONOMIC reforms introduced in 1991 have\nradically changed the course of the Indian\neconomy and led to its gradual integration with the\nglobal economy. Benefits of the reform process are\nvisible in the form of better growth rates, higher\ninvestment and trade flows.\n\nThe effect of these reforms on trade and investment\nrelations with the United States has been profound.\nIt is now not only the largest investor country in\nIndia, it is also India\u2019s largest trading partner.\n\nIndian economy today - a brief overview\n\nIndia is among the fastest growing economies of the\nworld today, with a growth rate of Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP) of 7% during the last 10 years. Dur-\ning 1999-2000 (April-March), GDP registered a 6.4%\ngrowth. Industrial production increased by 8%. The\nperformance of infrastructure sector improved sig-\nnificantly. Inflation rate was a nominal 2-3% for the\nfirst time in decades. Exports, in terms of U.S. dol-\nlars, increased by 11.6%. India also continued to\nmaintain a healthy balance of payments with for-\neign exchange reserves increasing by $6.1 billion\nduring the year to over $35 billion. All indications\nare that the economy will continue to maintain its\nstrong showing during the current fiscal year with\nexports recording a growth of over 28% and indus-\ntrial production of 5.6% during the first quarter\n(April-June 2000).\n\nU.S. Investments in India\n\nU.S. accounts for 22% of all foreign direct invest-\nment (FDI) approved in India (This excludes Euro\nissues and NRI investments). Between 1991 and\nJune 2000, out of the $63.1 billion foreign direct\ninvestments approved, the US constituted $14.2 bil-\nlion.\n\nCountry-wise FDI Approval (US $ million)\n\n \n\nU.S. is also the largest investor in terms of actual\nFDI inflow into India. U.S. FDI inflow was about $2.5\nbillion between 1991 and June 2000 against a total\nFDI inflow into the country of $21.3 billion. The\noverall U.S. FDI inflow-approval ratio is 18%. But\nduring the last three years, the ratio has improved to\n27%. This has registered a further significant im-\nprovement during the first six-months of 2000 and\nreached 33%.\n\nFDI Inflows from U.S.\n\n.\ni\n\n| 90s [ 992 | 1903 | 1904 | 1995 | 1906 | 1907 | rose | 1900 | 2000\" |\n[iia | as [477 | si0 [250 | 271.0 [7960 | s47.s [4912 | 200 |\n\n \n\nSectors predominantly attracting U.S. investment are:\n\n- Fuel (Power & Oil Refinery) - 38.93%\n\n- Food Processing Industries - 10.60%\n\n- Telecommunications - 10.35%\n\n- Service Sector (Financial & Non Financial Service)\n- 9.08%\n\n- Electrical Equipments (Computer software & Elec-\ntronics) - 8.48%\n\nForeign Investment\nIndustry-wise Inflows from USA\n(1999-2000)\n\n6%\n\n \n\nIn Portfolio Investment also, U.S. is the leading in-\nvestor.

This accounts\nfor about 49% of the total investments made by Fils\nsince 1993.\n\nInvestment by U.S. based Fils in India\n\n \n\nU.S. companies in India are involved in every sector\nthat is open to private investment. From infrastruc-\nture to consumer goods and from information tech-\nnology to consultancy services American companies\nare represented in India. During President Clinton\u2019s\nrecent visit to India, memoranda of understanding\n(MOUs) worth about $3.5 billion were signed by,\namong others, Motorola, Hughes Network Systems,\nBank of America, IBM, Enron and Ogden Energy.\n\nEconomic reforms in India:\n\nThe Government of India has renewed its commit-\nment to expand the reform process in order to gen-\nerate and sustain higher economic growth. In the\npast eleven months, a number of new initiatives\nhave been taken. These include:\n\n\u00a9 The passage of the Insurance Bill opening India\u2019s\ninsurance sector to private investors and setting\nup the Insurance Regulatory and Development\nAuthority (IRDA);\n\n\u00a2 Replacing the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act\n(FERA) with a more investor friendly Foreign Ex-\nchange Management Act (FEMA);\n\n\u00a9 The passage of the new Information Technology\n(IT) Bill;\n\n\u00a9 Creation of special economic zones to boost ex-\nports and removal of quantitative restrictions on\n714 additional items.\n\nSeveral trade-related legislations have also been\npassed such as the Trade Marks Bill, Geographical\nIndications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Bill,\nand the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, in order to\nmeet WTO requirements. Norms for Foreign Direct\n\nInvestments have been further liberalized and pto-\ncedures streamlined. India has now moved to a sys-\ntem where most investment proposals are approved\nautomatically.\n\nProspects for further\nIndia-U.S. economic cooperation:\n\nThere are several areas where economic coopera-\ntion between India and the U.S. can progress fur-\nther. These include IT, telecom, energy and other\nknowledge industries such as pharmaceuticals and\nbio-technology.\n\nThe IT sector is India\u2019s fastest growing sector with\nover 50% average annual growth since 1991. The\nturn over of the sector has increased from $2 billion\nin 1994-95 to $8.7 billion in 1999-2000. Today,\nnearly two in five of the Fortune 500 companies\noutsource their software requirements to India. As a\nconsequence, there has been remarkable growth in\nIndia\u2019s software exports too, from $485 million in\n1994-95 to $4 billion today. The share of North\nAmerica (U.S. & Canada) in India\u2019s software exports\nis about 62%. During 1999-2000, U.S. investment in\nthe computer industry in India accounted for over\n50 % of the total FDI inflow received by this sector.\n\nAbundant investment opportunities exist for further\nstrengthening India-U.S. economic ties in IT, espe-\ncially, in areas like communication infrastructure,\noptic fiber cable, gateways, satellite-based commu-\nnication wireless, IT-enabled services, IT enabled\neducation, data centers and server farms, and soft-\nware development.\n\nPharmaceuticals, biotechnology and chemical indus-\ntries also provide great opportunities for closer co-\noperation. The Finance Minister of India, Mr. Yash-\nwant Sinha stated during his recent visit to USA that\none of the most important areas where there is a\ntremendous synergy between Indian and American\nenterprises are knowledge based projects and ser-\nvices where both the countries have competitive\nadvantage as exporters. This is substantiated by the\nfact that India is one of the largest manufacturers\nand exporters of pharmaceuticals. It has a rich genetic\npool and a large family structure ideal for studying\ndiseases. It also holds the key for Genotype Drug\nDesign and is widely acclaimed for its large pool of\ntrained doctors and cost effective research & devel-\nopment (R&D) activities.\n\nSee INDIA-U.S. ECONOMIC RELATIONS, Page &\n\n \n\nz\n\nGoogle\n\n \n\nA 7",
